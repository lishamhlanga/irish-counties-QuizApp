QUIZ GAME - Irish Counties

This QUIZ APP is for all ages and designed it to be simple to use for kids, family , .Adults,  all ages .

In terms of the project I wanted to do a website but thought not to do as my last project was a website using HTML  and CSS .Thought about a game and had a chat with my tutor who helpe me a lot in selecting whats best . I had 2 choices a game and a fully responsive website that uses databases and mostly javascript. I then decided to do a game and the one I selected  I got the idea from LOVE MATHS. I decided on the topic and thought of why not try a quiz that will educate users about counties of Ireland and Provinces. Mainly most of the question that the user have to answer are counties.

This made me to research on WIKIPEDIA on Ireland and the counties the history of it all. I noticed that even my family did not know the counties well and the concept of the quiz was a great idea.
I had a first user and it was my daughter she loved it and at the end of about 4 times playing she knew most of the counties.

Features

Index Page

The index page has a Header and Game instructions and 2 buttons  below it.
The header is the title Irish Counties Quiz which is a self reflecting title to the user to know that its a quiz about Irish Counties
Below that I had a unordered list of instructions on how to play the game
Below that  2 buuton. a PLAY button and a FEEDBACK button.
There is an image that act as a background drop to give it a nice look. 
The colours and the font I chose are very light and comfortable to the eyes and clear as well.

Start Page

The start page is accessible only when the PLAY button is clicked and takes the user to the game.
Here the page has a logo , heading , question area and 4 answer areas, below that a next button and a score area.
The game is played manual that is the user clicks next to go to the second question , although I could have made it to shuffle automatically.
there are 18 questions so far but many can be added as well.

HOW the game works. The user checks the answers when presented with a question and then clicks on the one they thinkis right., if the answer is right the colour changes to grren and a window pop up to say correct. This act increments the score by 1 for every right answer and shows the score and the questions on the score area. It's the score relative to the total questions.

Once finished the user is presented with the final score and all buttons are hidden except the score and the restart button.
The restart button takes the user to the start page of the game and clears the score area for the next game.
The logo icon is used to naviagte back to the index page .
The user has an options to leave a feedback concerning the app quiz. The FEEDBACK button  when cliked takes the user to the Feedbaack page where they are presented with a blank screen with two opposite buttons left and right. Once cliked the form appears and the user can fill in and submit.
There is a replay game button as well that when clicked takes the user to the index page ,

Feedback page
The Feedback form is a simple form that prompts the user to enter their name and email nd whatever they have to say concerning the app. This will help me to see what's their response and how to improve the app quiz.

In designing the UI I had lots of ideas of which I will implement once the app is checked and graded.

Features Left to Implement

The app will have a login page and registration page for the user, that means users will be able to login using their own passwords and username.
The app will have a timer and there will be a choice of selecting with timer -timed- or without timer giving the user limited window to relax hence it's a good practice.
There will be an option of emailing the user their scores, to help the user to keep track of progress.
It will incorporate sounds as well an beeps when the timer is approaching to an end, and the sound will activate when the user get the right answer as well.
The scores will be announced as well making it multi player such that when one finshes the other logs in as well.
In terms of the design , I want to make it appealing yet looking fun for all audiences.
An ability to share scores as well and help each other in answerng the questions.

Testing

The quiz works when and does what i made it. Naviagation is easier although I will have to put a return button for the user to navigate to inde xpage main page from inside the game rather than using the logo. To test and see all functionality I used developer tools it's a gold tool as I was able to see the changes copy the code and paste it of change the code to how i preferred it. The quiz scales well for all devices with the use of media queries and flex to faciltate this.

I have tested it with various browsers and it renders well, Firefeox, Mozilla, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome. The images are all aligned horizontal and vertical and scale well on the mobile and desktop with the flex wrap kicking in to distribute the mobile experience of a single column beneath each other and scale as the surface view increase.

I also included required on the form that will highlight ( fill out this field ) if the user has left some areas unfilled. The form is responsive as well and scales for different screen sizes .

Test of Responsiveness

Difficulties Encountered

The lessons through the LMS were easy to follow and to grasp easier, eg all concepts of Javascrips from variable to DOM , issue came on how to implement them on the website. Firstly it was hard its like I was moving circles but what i discovered was using chrome developer tools console and snippets helped me a lot as I was able to manipulate and write code and execute changes. This method made me to understand the DOM better.

I had to research through youtube and stackflow  Overflow to master some of the concepts. The trick is all about practice practice of which i am doing now.

The game I wanted to include lots of functionality but time is the killer here, overall mananged to get it working by following my tutor advice to use a flow diagram , from step one to finish and the coding accordingly.
Javascript is very challenging but with practice and  study going through the lessons again and the challenges they did help me.
I wanted to do a nice presentation of the game but time was not on my side.
I encountered a challenge of resetting the game to  restart and the scores to revert to zero but with concentration found the solution.
Currently all was working fine and I included an image as a background , its not showing anymore might have to do with relative and absolute links . It worked before then i changed few things around and last minute it just stopped.

Hope I will be able to sort it before I submit the project.
