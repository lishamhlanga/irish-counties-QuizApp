QUIZ GAME - Irish Counties

This QUIZ APP love adventure, outgoing, family out, .Audience is all ages .

To do this project I had 3 choices in mind a DIY website, Helpline Website, ad lastly Donegal Best Beaches. The reason I choose the Donegal Famous beaches i found that many people were not aware of how beautiful the coastal drive is, housing beautiful outstanding beaches that rank higher in the world. I love taking my family to the beach so one time i tried to find beaches in Donegal and it wasn't an easy find. There are some hidden beaches which are not on the map very beautiful to visit.This website idea is geared to help people who love outdoors, adventure, nature and families to be able to view and have info in regard to nearest lovely beaches.

Testing

The site seems to work well , I have used the developer tools to check the site from different viewpoints mobile, tablet , desktop . The site scales well with the use of media queries that facilitate this. The navigation links which are present on every page makes it easier to navigate form one page to another and the back to top link on the bottom right footer position helps bring the user to the top of the screen. All the links have a hover link to help the user know which link they are and a color of gold is projected . The text used on the body is 16px seems to be right for both mobile and desktop with h1 and h2 highlighting the titles and sub titles. I have tested it with various browsers and it renders well, Firefeox, Mozilla, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome. The images are all aligned horizontal and vertical and scale well on the mobile and desktop with the flex wrap kicking in to distribute the mobile experience of a single column beneath each other and scale as the surface view increase.

The footer houses social media links with icons that when clicked open a new tab. addition to presentation the body area background is light blue,the colours I used are good for the eyes and does not strain the user.

The upload form makes it easier for the user to submit their beaches of interest for publication ,they can right on the comment section and then upload the image. I included an link to reduce the image if it's too big , maximum image size being 20mb.

I also included required on the form that will highlight ( fill out this field ) if the user has left some areas unfilled. The form is responsive as well and scales of different screen sizes . There is a google mapat the bootom of the upload page which users can click the red dot to display information about the beach , and where its located.

Difficulties Encountered

The lessons through the LMS were easy to follow and to grasp easier like when all concepts of Javascrips from variable to DOM , issue came on how to implement them on the website. Firstly it was hard its like I was moving circles but what i discovered was using chrome developer tools console and snippets helped me a lot as I was able to manipulate and write code and execute changes. This method made me to understand the DOM better.

I had to research through youtube and stackflow  Overflow to master some of the concepts. The trick is all about practice practice of which i am doing.

The game I wanted to include lots of functionality but time is the killer here, overall managed to get it working by following my tutor advice to use a flow diagram , from step one to finish and the coding accordingly.
Javascript is very challenging but with practice and  study going through the lessons again and the challenges they did help me.
I wanted to do a nice presentation of the game but time was not on my side.
I encountered a challenge of resetting the game to  restart and the scores to revert to zero but with concentration found the solution.
